      <h3>Role in the OPS Architecture</h3>

      <p>The OPS Architecture [[OPS-ARCH]] provides a high-level view of the 
      Open PHACTS framework, with a detailed specification of the identity and 
      vocabulary services given in [[OPS-IV]]. The Open PHACTS RDF guidelines 
      [[OPS-RDF]] specify the vocabularies that are recommended for publishing 
      datasets for use in the OPS system. This specification defines the format 
      of identity mapping linksets that relate the concepts in the various datasets 
      loaded in OPS. The provenance and metadata guidelines about the linksets given 
      in this specification should be used in conjunction with the equivalent 
      statements in the RDF publication guidelines [[OPS-RDF]].</p>

      <p>The identity mapping linksets will predominantly be used as the means 
      to import data to the Identity Mapping Service (IMS) [[IMS]] through the 
      interface defined in Section 4.4.2 of [[OPS-IV]]. The mapping specification 
      will also form the basis of the information model returned through the 
      Identity Mapping Service query interface defined in 
      Section 4.4.1 of [[OPS-IV]].</p>

      <h3>Open PHACTS RDF Guidelines</h3>
      <p>The Open PHACTS project has produced a set of guidelines aimed at
      data providers for publishing their data within the OPS system [[!OPS-RDF]].
      The guide provides details about data licenses and publishing a dataset
      description using VoID. This mapping specification exploits these 
      existing VoID descriptions.</p>

    <h3>RDF Syntax Used for Examples</h3>
    <p>All examples in this document are written in the 
    <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/turtle/">Turtle RDF syntax</a> 
    [[TURTLE]]. Throughout the document, the following namespaces are used:</p>

	<pre class="turtle">
@prefix dcterms: &lt;http://purl.org/dc/terms/&gt; .
@prefix foaf: &lt;http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/&gt; .
@prefix owl: &lt;http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#&gt; .

	<p>Furthermore, we assume that the empty prefix is bound to the base URL 
	of the current file like this:</p>

	<pre class="turtle">@prefix : &lt;#&gt; .</pre>

      <h3>Vocabulary of Interlinked Datasets (VoID)</h3>
      <p>The Vocabulary of Interlinked Datasets (VoID) [[!VOID]] is a W3C 
      interest group note that specifies a vocabulary for describing the 
      metadata about a dataset and its relationship with other datasets. 
      The vocabulary builds upon existing metadata vocabularies, e.g. 
      Dublin Core Terms [[DCTERMS]].</p>

	  <p>The VoID specification [[VOID]] provides the following 
	  definitions:</p>
	  <dl>
	  	<dt>Dataset</dt>
	  	<dd>A set of RDF triples that are published, maintained 
	  	or aggregated by a single provider.</dd>
	  	<dt>Link</dt>
	  	<dd>An RDF triple whose subject and object are described in 
	  	different datasets.</dd>
	  	<dt>Linkset</dt>
	  	<dd>A collection of such RDF links between two datasets.</dd>
	  </dl>

	  <p>The VoID specification enables a separation between (1) the 
	  datasets involved in a link, and (2) who publishes the link.</p>

	  <p>Note that a VoID linkset is defined to link two datasets via a 
	  single link predicate (void:linkPredicate). As such, there can 
	  exist multiple linksets relating the same pair of datasets. The 
	  following are examples of some of the multiple linksets that can 
	  exist between datasets ChemSpider and ChEMBL:</p>
	  <ul>
		<li>ChemSpider <code>cs:extUrl</code> ChEMBL as
				published in the ChemSpider dataset</li>
		<li>ChemSpider <code>cs:...</code> ChEMBL as
				published in the ChemSpider dataset</li>
		<li>ChEMBL <code>:csid</code> ChemSpider as
				published in the ChEMBL dataset</li>
		<li>ChEMBL <code>:somePredicate</code>
				ChemSpider as published by some third party</li>
	</ul>
	
      <h4>Vocabulary for Data and Dataset Provenance (voidp)</h4>
      <p>Defined as an extension to VoID, the vocabulary for data and dataset 
	  provenance (voidp) [[VOIDP]] is a vocabulary for defining provenance 
	  relationships of data and datasets. The vocabulary focuses on four 
      specific pieces of provenance information:</p>
	  <blockquote>"for a piece of data, x : 
	  <ul>
		<li>when was x derived,</li>
		<li>how was x derived,</li>
		<li>what data had been used to derive x,</li>
		<li>who carried out the transformations that resulted in the current 
		value of x." [[VOIDP]]</li>
	  </ul>
      </blockquote>
	  <p>These are a subset of the information that needs to be captured for 
      the Open PHACTS linksets.</p>

	  <p>The vocabulary provides its own predicates for capturing these 
      provenance relationships, rather than reusing existing vocabularies for 
      capturing provenance metadata, e.g. the open provenance model [[OPM]] or 
      Provenance Authoring and Versioning ontology [[PAV]]. There is now also 
      a W3C group working on a provenance ontology [[PROV-O]].</p>

  	<h2>Anatomy of a Mapping Specification</h2>
  	
  	<p>A data instance mapping is a claim that an identifier in one dataset is 
  	related in some way to an identifier in another dataset. The mapping 
  	specification captures the type of relationship and the metadata associated 
  	with the mapping, e.g. provenance information about who created the mapping 
  	and the specific versions of the datasets related.</p>

	<p>Example linksets are given in <a href="#example-linksets">Appendix A</a>. 
    The example linkset in <a href="#CW2CSLinkset">Appendix A.1</a> presents a 
    simple case where a set of ConceptWiki resources are mapped to a set of 
    ChemSpider resources. <a href="#CS2C2B2RChemblLinkset">Appendix A.2</a> 
    presents a more complex example which relates the ChemSpider dataset to 
    the ChEMBL compounds dataset as represented by the Chem2Bio2RDF conversion 
    of ChEMBL version 2 [[Chem2Bio2RDF]].</p>
    
    <section id="mapping-representation">
      <h3>Representing a Mapping</h3>
      
      <p>A mapping must be represented as a VoID link, i.e. it is an RDF triple 
      that relates an identifier in one dataset with an identifier in another 
      dataset with some predicate which provides the meaning of the mapping.</p>
      
      <p>The mapping predicate captures the way in which the two identifiers are 
      related. The mapping should respect the semantics of the relationship, i.e. 
      the owl:sameAs relationship must only be used when the two identifiers are 
      completely interchangeable.</p>
      
      <p>Halpin et al [[Halpin2010]] propose a mapping relationship ontology 
      with eight levels of equivalence: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Identical (equivalent to <code>owl:sameAs</code>): always interchangeable</li>
        <li>Claims Identical: inverse does not hold</li>
        <li>Matches (equivalent to <code>skos:exactMatch</code>): share many properties, 
        interchangeable in most cases</li>
        <li>Claims Matches: inverse does not hold</li>
        <li>Similar (equivalent to <code>skos:closeMatch</code>): share some properties, not 
        interchangeable</li>
        <li>Claims Similar: inverse does not hold</li>
        <li>Related (equivalent to <code>skos:related</code>): distinct things with an 
        association</li>
        <li>Claims Related (equivalent to <code>rdfs:seeAlso</code>)</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h4>Example</h4>
      <p>The following example declares that the ChemSpider α-Ketoisovaleric acid
      concept with the <a href="http://www.chemspider.com/48">CSID 48</a> shares 
      many properties with the ChEMBL 3-Methyl-2-oxobutanoic acid concept with 
      the Chem2Bio2RDF 
      <a href="http://cheminfov.informatics.indiana.edu:8080/chembl/page/chembl_compounds/289013">
      ChEMBL ID 289013</a>. The relationship is drawn from ChemSpider based on 
      the compounds sharing the same structure based on their InChI Keys (in 
      this case the compound has the same InChI Key QHKABHOOEWYVLI-UHFFFAOYSA-N 
      in both data sets.).</p>

      <h3>Metadata</h3>
      
      <p>The metadata associated with a link is essential for enabling its reuse
      by others. It enables a consumer of the link to understand who claimed the
      link, under what circumstances, and which (if any) tools were used to 
      generate the link (e.g. [[SILK]]).</p>
      
      <p>The metadata is split into metadata about the dataset and the metadata
      about the links themselves. Note that the dataset metadata should be
      provided by the dataset provider as part of the dataset publishing process
      [[OPS-RDF]], although it can be augmented for the purposes of providing
      additional information about the link.</p>
      
      <section id=dataset-metadata>
      <h3>Dataset Metadata</h3>
      
      <p>A linkset associates two datasets via a single mapping predicate. For 
      each dataset in the linkset, the following metadata must be included:</p>
      
      <p style="font-weight: bold;">Type</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Declare that we have a dataset using <code>void:dataset</code>.</li>
      </ul>

      <p style="font-weight: bold;">License</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Provide details of the licence under which the dataset is published 
      using the <code>dcterms:license</code> property.</li>
      </ul>

      <p style="font-weight: bold;">Version</p>
      <ul>
      <li>If the dataset has the notion of publication versions then this must 
      be captured using the <code>pav:Version</code> property.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p style="font-weight: bold;">Source Provenance</p>
      <ul>
      <li>If the dataset is derived from another data source, i.e. the knowledge 
      content has changed, then the following properties should be given:
        <ul>
          <li><code>pav:derivedFrom</code> to capture the relationship to the 
          original source.</li>
          <li><code>pav:derivedOn</code> to capture when the derivation was made.</li>
          <li><code>pav:derivedBy</code> to capture who made the derivation. The
          object of this triple is a URI, currently we recommend using FOAF [[FOAF]].</li>          
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>If the dataset has been retrieved from another location, i.e. it is 
      used in exactly the same form, then the following properties should be given:
        <ul>
          <li><code>pav:retrievedFrom</code> to capture the location of the 
          original source.</li>
          <li><code>pav:retrievedOn</code> to capture when the retrieval was made.</li>
          <li><code>pav:retrievedBy</code> to capture who made the retrieval. The
          object of this triple is a URI, currently we recommend using FOAF [[FOAF]].</li>          
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>If the dataset is imported from another data source, i.e. the 
      knowledge content is unchanged but the format of the data has been changed 
      (e.g. XML to RDF transformation), then the following properties should be given:
        <ul>
          <li><code>pav:importedFrom</code> to capture the location of the 
          original source.</li>
          <li><code>pav:importedOn</code> to capture when the import was made.</li>
          <li><code>pav:importedBy</code> to capture who made the import. The
          object of this triple is a URI, currently we recommend using FOAF [[FOAF]].</li>          
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>If the dataset and its description are accessed from their original 
      location, then the no properties are required. However it is good practice
      to include the following:
        <ul>
          <li>Details of who is publishing the dataset using the 
          <code>dcterms:publisher</code> property.</li>
          <li>Details of when the dataset was created using the 
          <code>dcterms:created</code> property.</li>
          <li>When appropriate, details of when the last update was made using
          the <code>dcterms:modified</code> property.</li>
        </ul>
      </ul>
      <p id="orcid-note" class="note">We currently recommend the use of FOAF to capture the
      person or entity that made a dataset available. In the future, we anticipate
      the use of ORCID Identifiers [[ORCID]].</p>
      
      <p style="font-weight: bold;">Namespace</p>
      <ul>
      <li>The URI namespace for the resources being linked is declared using the
       <code>void:uriSpace</code> property. Note that the object of the triple
       is a literal, not a URI.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p style="font-weight: bold;">Resource Type</p>
      <ul>
      <li>The type of the resource being linked is declared with the 
      <code>dcterm:subject</code> predicate.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>In order to support applications using the linkset to understand and 
      present the data, the following additional metadata should be included:</p>
      
      <p style="font-weight: bold;">Title</p>
      <ul>
      <li>The title of the dataset using 
      <code>dcterm:title</code> predicate.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p style="font-weight: bold;">Description</p>
      <ul>
      <li>A description of the dataset using  
      <code>dcterm:description</code> predicate.</li>
      </ul>

      <p style="font-weight: bold;">Links to further information</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A link to the homepage for the dataset <code>foaf:hompage</code>.</li>
        <li>Other pages that discuss the dataset may be included with the 
        <code>foaf:page</code> relationship.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p style="font-weight: bold;">Data source</p>
      <ul>
        <li>If the dataset contains distinguishable subsets, e.g. ChEMBL Compounds
        or ChemSpider to ChEMBL links, then these should be declared as subsets 
        of the main dataset using the <code>void:subset</code> predicate. 
        The metadata that is common between the datasets can be declared for the 
        parent only.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p class="note">In the VoID note [[VOID]], the <code>void:subset</code> 
      propterty is used for both <em>subset of</em> and <em>has subset</em>. 
      The declared semantics for the property is <em>has subset</em>. Within 
      OPS, the property must be used with the <em>has subset</em> semantics.
      Therefore, if a linkset appears as a subset of a dataset, then it should
      be declared in the dataset metadata.</p>

      <p>Other metadata that can be associated with a dataset may be included, 
      see the RDF publishing guidelines [[OPS-RDF]], the VoID specification [[VOID]], 
      and the provenance, authorship and versioning vocabulary [[PAV]] for 
      additional metadata that may be incorporated. The dataset may also have a 
      provenance graph associated with it providing more detailed information 
      about the creation, authorship, and derivation of the dataset.</p>

      <p class="note">The above example shows the use of a blank node for stating
      where the data has been imported from. This could alternatively be 
      captured through the declaration of another dataset containing the 
      appropriate properties. It also assumes the existence of a local description

      <h3>Linkset Metadata</h3>
      
      <p>A linkset is itself a dataset, and as such should provide the metadata 
      one would associate with a dataset, as stated 
      <a href="#dataset-metadata">above</a>. Specifically, the following 
      metadata must be included:</p>

      <p style="font-weight: bold;">Type</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Declare that we have a linkset using <code>void:linkset</code>.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p class="note">The <code>void:linkset</code> predicate is a sub-property
      of the <code>void:dataset</code> property.</p>

      <p style="font-weight: bold;">License</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Provide details of the licence under which the linkset is published 
      using the <code>dcterms:license</code> property.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p class="note">The license under which a linkset is published may be 
      different from that of the dataset.</p>

      <p style="font-weight: bold;">Linkset Provenance</p>
      <ul>
      <li>If the linkset is a subset of another dataset, then this is captured 
      with the <code>void:subset</code> predicate, with the linkset URI as the
      object of the triple.</li>
      <li>The linkset authorship, i.e. the agent that generated the intellectual 
      knowledge, is captured with the following properties:
        <ul>
          <li><code>pav:authoredBy</code> to capture who authored the links.
          Currently we recommend the use of FOAF [[FOAF]] for the objects of
          these triples, see <a href="#orcid-note">note</a> above about future
          use of ORCID identifiers.</li>
          <li><code>pav:authorOn</code> to capture when the links were generated.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>The linkset creator, i.e. the entity responsible for converting the 
      links to the linkset format, is captured with the following properties:
        <ul>
          <li><code>pav:createdBy</code> to capture who converted the links into
          the current digital format.
          Currently we recommend the use of FOAF [[FOAF]] for the objects of
          these triples, see <a href="#orcid-note">note</a> above about future
          use of ORCID identifiers.</li>
          <li><code>pav:createdOn</code> to capture when the links were converted
          to their digital form.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      </ul>    
      <p>Additional information about how the links were created should be stated.
      For example, if the links were created using a tool such as Silk [[SILK]].
      The links may also contain provenance information represented using
      PROV-O [[PROV-O]] and captured in a separate provenance graph.</p>  
      
      <p style="font-weight: bold;">Linkset Metadata</p>
      <ul>
      <li>A declaration must be made about the datasets that are linked using
      the <code>void:subjectsTarget</code> and <code>void:objectsTarget</code>
      properties.</li>
      <li>The link predicate is declared using <code>void:linkPredicate</code>.</li>
      <li>The number of links in the linkset is declared using 
      <code>void:triples</code>. This allows for validation that the entire 
      linkset has been successfully loaded.
      </ul>
      
      <p>In order to support applications using the linkset to understand and 
      present the data, the following additional metadata should be included:</p>
      
      <p style="font-weight: bold;">Title</p>
      <ul>
      <li>The title of the linkset using 
      <code>dcterm:title</code> predicate.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p style="font-weight: bold;">Description</p>
      <ul>
      <li>A description of the linkset using  
      <code>dcterm:description</code> predicate.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>Note that for linksets there is unlikely to be a web page directly 
      dedicated to the linkset, as such that part of the dataset metadata is 
      not stated as a requirement.</p>
      
      <h4>Example</h4>
      
      <p>The following example is the metadata associated with a link connecting
      a ChemSpider compound with a ChEMBL molecule. It reuses the dataset 
      descriptions given in the examples <a href="#dataset-metadata">above</a>.</p>
