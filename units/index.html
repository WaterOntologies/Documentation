    <h4>Intended audience</h4>
    <p>
      These guidelines are intended for data providers who want to expose their data as RDF to the Open
      PHACTS platform.

  <section id="abstract">
    This guideline describes how units for data are preferably encoded, setting a standard that can then
    be handled uniformaly by data consumers.

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      One of the goals of Open PHACTS is to provide a uniform platform for integration of data important
      to drug discovery [[Williams2012]]. There are many aspects of the data in the integrated resources
      that need consideration, but this guideline focuses on provide machine readable access to unit
      and unit type information.
    </p>
    <p>
      The importance of making that information machine readable is that it allow consumers to search for
      data in a uniform way. That is, the platform no longer relies on data providers to use the same
      units. For data providers it means that they can just provide their data in the original units.
      For example, the ChEMBL database tracks both the units used in the data sources (e.g. literature)
      as well as report a standard unit. That allows the ChEMBL web interface to search drugs with
      IC<sub>50</sub> value below a certain molarity expressed in nM.
      However, a major downside of this approach is that it requires to standardize these values
      explicitly in the database, and it requires search interfaces to still use this unit.
    </p>
    <p>
      A solution to this is to use a unit ontology, like the QUDT ontology (Quantities, Units,
      Dimensions, and Types). Using such semantic annotation, we can reason on how to convert
      units of the same type into each other. For example, it allows us to convert micromolar into
      nanomolar automatically. Even more, if search engines use the ontology too, the user can
      search in any molar unit type, and the data can capture the data in any unit type.
    </p>
    </p>
      In fact, the QUDT ontology does not only provide entries for units, it also provides a full
      framework to express how units can be interconverted. Of course, this is limited o units of
      the same type, e.g. molar concentration. It does not provide us means to convert a molar
      concentration into a weight per volume unit. That would require additional information on
      the subject of study, such as the molecular weight, but also information about purity.
